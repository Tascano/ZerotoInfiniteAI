Building on Chapter 1's broad AI historical context, this chapter traces the specific evolution of machine learning—from the biological inspiration of the 1940s through today's foundation models. Understanding this progression is crucial for modern practitioners: every algorithm we use in production today has deep historical roots, and recognizing these patterns helps predict where the field is heading next.

We'll follow the technical thread from McCulloch-Pitts neurons to transformers, examining not just what happened, but why certain approaches succeeded while others failed. This isn't merely academic history—it's the story of how incremental advances in mathematics, computation, and data availability culminated in the AI capabilities we see today.
