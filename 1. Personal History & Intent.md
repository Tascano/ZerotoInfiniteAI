This curriculum represents my personal roadmap through the vast landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning. What began as scattered notes, bookmarked papers, and completed courses has evolved into this comprehensive learning resource.

Like many others fascinated by AI's potential, I found myself navigating a fragmented educational landscape—piecing together MOOCs, research papers, YouTube tutorials, and hands-on projects to build a coherent understanding. From implementing my first neural network to deploying production AI systems, from reading foundational papers by Hinton and LeCun to experimenting with the latest LLMs, every chapter in this curriculum reflects something I've learned, struggled with, or mastered.

**Why Share This?** I realized that my learning journey—with all its detours, breakthroughs, and "aha!" moments—might serve others facing the same challenge: **How do you learn everything about AI when the field is so vast and fast-moving?**

This isn't a commercial course or academic program. It's simply a learning tracker and resource compilation that maps out everything I believe someone should know to truly understand AI—from mathematical foundations to the latest breakthrough applications.

The AI community has given me so much through open-source code, freely available research papers, and generous knowledge sharing. This curriculum is my way of giving back—a structured pathway for anyone who shares the same curiosity and ambition to understand AI deeply.

Whether you're a complete beginner wondering where to start, a professional looking to deepen your knowledge, or a researcher seeking comprehensive coverage of the field, I hope this serves as a useful roadmap for your own learning journey.

As I continue learning and the field continues evolving, so will this curriculum. It's a living document that reflects not just where AI has been, but where it's heading—and where our understanding needs to go to keep pace.

_Feel free to use this as your own learning tracker, modify it for your needs, or simply as inspiration for your AI journey. The goal is simple: to help curious minds navigate the incredible world of artificial intelligence._
